Rules to follow when developing:
1: Comment what you type, but dont over comment.
2: Dont just copy paste code everywhere, if code is being used in copy/paste, then it can be condensed to a method to make it cleaner, and easier to read/type/use
(rules up for changing)


Quick references:

When creating items that are going to be used for crafting/smelting, such as ores, and ingots, add it to com.error22.thelta.common.CraftingMaterials
Any world generation, add it to the worldgen module
